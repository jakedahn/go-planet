go-planet - Unofficial Planet.com API Client ![](https://travis-ci.org/jakedahn/go-planet.svg) ![](http://gocover.io/_badge/github.com/jakedahn/go-planet/planet)
============================================

This is the first pass at a golang api client for the planet.com API. This is very experimental, and unlikely to work, please do not use until this readme claims that things should work.

### TODO

* scenes endpoint
* mosaics endpoint
* setup travisci

### questions

* How do we test/mock an HTTP request? (aka verify that the client built a specific request and sent it to a server)?
* How do we setup benchmarks?
